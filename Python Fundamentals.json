    "question": "How does Python’s execution model impact performance and debugging compared to compiled languages?",
    "short_answer": "Python compiles to bytecode and executes via an interpreter, which may reduce speed but improves debugging flexibility.",
    "detailed_explanation": "Python source code is compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This introduces runtime overhead compared to fully compiled languages like C++ or Java. However, Python enables faster debugging because developers can run code immediately without full recompilation. Errors are detected at runtime when the problematic line executes.",

    "question": "If Python is slower than Java or C++, why is it widely used in production systems?",
    "short_answer": "Because Python maximizes developer productivity and uses optimized libraries.",
    "detailed_explanation": "Python’s concise syntax and large ecosystem significantly reduce development time. Many heavy computations are delegated to optimized C/C++ extensions (NumPy, Pandas). Python is widely used in web development, automation, AI/ML, scripting, and microservices where development speed and maintainability outweigh raw execution speed.",

    "question": "How does Python support both procedural and object-oriented programming?",
    "short_answer": "Through functions (procedural) and classes (OOP).",
    "detailed_explanation": "Python is a multi-paradigm language. Developers can write procedural code using functions and control flow, or object-oriented code using classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Python also supports functional programming features.",

    "question": "What happens when an object is no longer used in Python?",
    "short_answer": "Memory is reclaimed via reference counting and garbage collection.",
    "detailed_explanation": "Python uses reference counting to track object usage. When references drop to zero, memory can be freed. Python also includes a cyclic garbage collector to handle reference cycles that reference counting cannot resolve.",
