1️⃣ Python Execution Model (Interpreted Language)
Definition

Python is an interpreted language. Code executes line by line via the Python interpreter.

Key Concept

No manual compilation step.

Example
print("Hello")


Runs immediately.

Scenario

You run a script → Error appears instantly if something fails.

Why It Matters

✔ Faster debugging
❌ Slower than compiled languages

2️⃣ Performance vs Compiled Languages
Definition

Python is generally slower than C/Java due to interpretation and dynamic typing.

Scenario

Web app → Python OK
Game engine → Prefer C++

Example
sum(range(1000000))


Works fine but not as fast as C.

Why It Matters

✔ Productivity often outweighs speed

3️⃣ Why Python is Widely Used
Definition

Python emphasizes developer productivity.

Key Benefits

✔ Simple syntax
✔ Massive libraries
✔ Rapid development

Scenario

Startup building MVP quickly → Python ideal

4️⃣ Procedural Programming in Python
Definition

Code organized using functions and steps.

Example
def greet():
    print("Hello")

Scenario

Small scripts & utilities

5️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Definition

Code organized using classes and objects.

Example
class User:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello")

Scenario

Large, scalable systems

6️⃣ Dynamic Typing
Definition

Variable types determined at runtime.

Example
x = 10
x = "hello"

Scenario

Variable reused with different types

Risk
x = "10"
print(x + 5)  # TypeError

7️⃣ Readability Philosophy
Definition

Python prioritizes clean, human-readable code.

Example
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")

Scenario

Team project → Easier maintenance

8️⃣ Code Maintainability
Definition

Readable code reduces bugs & onboarding time.

Scenario

New developer joins → Understands logic faster

9️⃣ Memory Management
Definition

Python uses automatic memory management.

Mechanism

✔ Reference counting
✔ Garbage collection

Example
a = [1, 2]
a = None


Old object eligible for cleanup.

🔟 Garbage Collection
Definition

Handles cyclic references not freed by reference counting.

Scenario

Objects referencing each other → GC cleans them

1️⃣1️⃣ Python Portability
Definition

Python code runs on multiple OS via interpreter.

Scenario

Same script → Windows / Linux / macOS

1️⃣2️⃣ Development Speed
Definition

Python’s standard library reduces coding effort.

Example
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))


No need to implement sqrt.

1️⃣3️⃣ PEP 8 (Coding Standards)
Definition

Official Python style guide.

Purpose

✔ Consistency
✔ Readability
✔ Maintainability

Example
# Good
user_name = "Satya"

# Bad
UserName="Satya"
